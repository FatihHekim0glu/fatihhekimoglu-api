"""Two-leg cross-exchange arbitrage scan.

Given the same symbol on two (or more) venues, the cross-exchange gross spread
for a target notional ``Q`` is the **sell-VWAP on the rich venue** minus the
**buy-VWAP on the cheap venue**, both walked to ``Q``. Pricing the spread off
walked books (not top-of-book) is what makes the resulting edge honest: the
deeper the required ``Q``, the more the gross spread shrinks.

Importing this module has no side effects.

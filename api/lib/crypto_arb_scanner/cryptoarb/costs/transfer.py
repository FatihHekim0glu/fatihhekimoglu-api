"""Per-asset withdrawal + network/settlement transfer cost.

Cross-exchange arbitrage requires moving the asset (or its quote) between
venues, which costs a flat withdrawal fee plus a network/settlement latency
penalty. The latency penalty is real: while the asset is in transit the quoted
edge can evaporate, so it is amortized into the cost in basis points. Transfer
cost is the leg that most often flips a positive gross edge negative.

Schedules are loaded from the reference ``profiles/*.yaml`` files. Importing
this module has no side effects.

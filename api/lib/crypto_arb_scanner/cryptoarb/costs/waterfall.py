"""Gross -> net cost waterfall.

This module assembles the honest headline: it starts from the executable gross
spread (already depth-/slippage-aware from VWAP-walked books) and subtracts, in
order, round-trip taker fees and transfer cost to arrive at the **net edge**.
The result is a :class:`Waterfall` whose stages render directly as the frontend
gross -> net waterfall bar. A :class:`CompositeCost` bundles the fee + transfer
schedules loaded from a single profile so callers configure costs once.

Importing this module has no side effects.

    Stages, in order: ``gross`` (anchor) -> ``-taker_fees`` (both legs) ->

    a separate stage because it is already baked into ``gross_bps`` by walking
